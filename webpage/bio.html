        	<div class = "col-sm-12">
            	<p>I was originally born in Kiev, Ukraine.
					In the early 2000's, I moved to Canada, where I would live near Ottawa for the next few years.
					Around 2009, I moved overseas, where I would spend the next 8 years travelling to many countries.<br><br>
					Here is a complete list of all countries I have traveled to:
					<br><br>
					<ul id="countries">
						<li>Canada</li>
						<li>United Kingdom</li>
						<li>Finland</li>
						<li>Germany</li>
						<li>Poland</li>
						<li>Ukraine</li>
						<li>Czech Republic</li>
						<li>Egypt</li>
						<li>United Arab Emirates</li>
						<li>Qatar</li>
						<li>Oman</li>
						<li>India</li>
						<li>Sri Lanka</li>
						<li>Thailand</li>
						<li>Vietnam</li>
					</ul>
					<br><br>
					For my first year, I lived in Cairo, Egypt, but soon after I moved to Qatar. I first attended Al Khor International School
					for my middle-school years. There I would complete both Bronze and Silver Standards of the Duke of Edinburgh Award.
					As part of the Expedition component of the Standards, I went hiking and camping in the Al Thakira Mangroves for my Bronze Award,
					and traversing the dunes of the Omani desert for my Silver Award. For the Creativity component of the Award, I would 
					pursue Scottish Dancing, which I attended up until my last month in Qatar.
					<br><br>
					For my last two years in Qatar, I moved to International School of London in Qatar, where I would complete my IB Diploma.
					At graduation, I was awarded the
					<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwQoOx1VOuhRZTNzREpvQTBtU1IySUlsWVIzWDhIU2JiWFln/view?usp=sharing">
					Global Citizenship and Community Action award</a> for my above-and-beyond commitment to maintaining many activities throughout the IB Diploma,
					such as personal youth mentorship, Peace Week event coodinating, and daily jogging, to name a few.
					I was also praised for scoring top grades in my class for English SL, French SL, and Physics HL throughout the programme.
					<br><br>
					After I completed my Diploma, I am very grateful that I was accepted
					to continue my studies at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> for Computer Engineering.
					For my first year, I have completed various courses, such as:
					<br><br>
					<ul id="courses">
						<li>CHE 102: Chemistry for Engineers</li>
						<li>ECE 105: Classical Mechanics</li>
						<li>Math 115: Linear Algebra (Engineering)</li>
						<li>Math 117: Calculus 1 for Engineering</li>
						<li>ECE 150: Fundamentals of Programming</li>
						<li>ECE 190: Engineering Profession & Practice</li>
						<li>ECE 106: Electricity and Magnetism</li>
						<li>ECE 108: Discrete Math and Logic 1</li>
						<li>Math 119: Calculus 2 for Engineering</li>
						<li>ECE 124: Digital Circuits and Systems</li>
						<li>ECE 140: Linear Circuits</li>
					</ul>
					<br><br>
					Apart from studies, I have been a part of the Electrical subteam for <a href="https://teamwaterloop.ca/">Waterloop</a>,
					a student design team that competes in annual SpaceX competitions to build a working Hyperloop pod. While no student
					in my cohort would deny that first year was brutal, I was able to manage well and progress with my studies.
					I am currently in my 2nd year of Engineering, where I am currently enjoying my studies and searching for my second co-op 
					opportunity.
