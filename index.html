	<p>I've completed a Fundamentals of Programming course in my first year with C++, where I've handled dynamic memory allocation through linked lists that utilized class and struct definitions. I've also done file analysis, error checking and creation, as well as creating, sorting, and storing abstract data structures. I've also done self-learning in Python, Java, and Javascript.
